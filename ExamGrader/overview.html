<h2 id="DesignOverview">Design Overview</h2>
<p>
Our main design priorities are modularity, flexibility, and testing.
</p>
<p>
Specific areas of concern are:
</p>
<p>- Isolating UI code from application logic in order to simplify replacing the UI. The app shall support both a console and a Swing UI without any duplication of business logic.</p>
<p>- Simplify the testing of isolated components. This includes testing as much of the UI as possible.</p>
<p>- Make it possible to multi-thread the grading for performance improvements.</p>
<p>- Reduce the number of dependencies of our classes on the libraries we use.</p>
<p>
Our application follows the use of the Supervising Controller pattern. The <tt>Controller</tt> class will coordinate model objects to handle user input from the view, which may be any class implementing <tt>AppView</tt>. The view will observe the <tt>Observable</tt> top-level model objects to handle simple UI changes. The Controller manages UI errors by calling a method on the <tt>AppView</tt>.
</p>
<h3 id="ObservableModels">Observable Models</h3>
<p>
There are three <tt>Observable</tt> models.
</p>
<h4 id="InputFileList"><tt>InputFileList</tt></h4>
<p>
<tt>InputFileList</tt> manages input files, reporting on the number of pages that have been loaded.
</p>
<p>
<tt>InputFileList</tt> contains a list of <tt>InputFile</tt>, each of which contains an answer key <tt>InputPage</tt> and a list of student <tt>InputPage</tt>. An <tt>InputPage</tt> represesens a single bubble form from an input file that can be converted to an <tt>Exam</tt>.
</p>
<h4 id="Grader"><tt>Grader</tt></h4>
<p>
A <tt>Grader</tt> grades the <tt>InputFileList</tt> passed to it, produce a <tt>GradedExamCollection</tt> for each <tt>InputFile</tt>. It tracks its own progress based on the number of pages graded thus far.
</p>
<p>
For each <tt>InputPage</tt> (including both student exams and the answer key), the <tt>Grader</tt> will do the following:
</p>
<p>
1. Convert from <tt>InputPage</tt> to <tt>Exam</tt> representations, which is an format-independent representation of a filled in bubble form. <tt>Grader</tt> uses <tt>ExamReader</tt> to perform this process. The <tt>ExamReader</tt> calls <tt>NameRecognitionGateway</tt> and <tt>StudentNameMapper</tt> to recognize and convert the name on the <tt>InputPage</tt> to a <tt>String</tt>.
</p>
<p>
2. For each student <tt>Exam</tt>, score against the answer key <tt>Exam</tt> for the <tt>InputFile</tt> the <tt>Exam</tt> was generated from, notifying any <tt>Observers</tt> when an exam is completed.
</p>
<p>
These tasks will be parallelized.
</p>
<h4 id="ReportWriter"><tt>ReportWriter</tt></h4>
<p>
A <tt>ReportWriter</tt> accepts a map of <tt>GradedExamCollection</tt>s representing each input PDF.  The mapping maps the output <tt>File</tt> to the <tt>GradedExamCollection</tt>. When prompted, the <tt>ReportWriter</tt> writes all the reports necessary for each <tt>GradedExamCollection</tt>. A single <tt>AggregateReport</tt> object is instantiated, and the overall statistics and results are printed as a CSV text file. For each <tt>Exam</tt> in the <tt>GradedExamCollection</tt>, an <tt>ExamReport</tt> is created. The <tt>ExamReport</tt> writes the results intended to be viewed by the student as an HTML text document.
