### Bubblit

Bubblit is a Java-based OMR tool for grading multiple choice exams.
It's kinda like that one ubiquitious exam scanning product that basically
every academic institution uses, except not.

Check out the [user manual](http://cytancy.github.io/BubblitUserManual/) for
screenshots and the like.

#### Project Background

This was a project for [Dr. John Dalbey's](http://www.johndalbey.com/) CPE-370
Software Engineering course at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

The project was managed using [this wiki](wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/jdSpr15team1), which
contains many valuable resources (including a [bundled JAR file](https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/jdSpr15team1/wiki/DownloadPageV2) and [various blank exam forms](https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/jdSpr15team1/wiki/bubblitform)
as PDF documents).

Don't forget to check out our hecka-cute [team photo](https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/jdSpr15team1/wiki/TeamPhoto).


#### IDE

This is a NetBeans project. If you check it out, you can open it in NetBeans.
Or, there are build targets specified in an Ant-friendly way, if you prefer Ant
you can just build with that instead.

#### License

We're still figuring that out.
